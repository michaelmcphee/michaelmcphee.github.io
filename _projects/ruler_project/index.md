## Design Objectives
- Design and build a custom displacement measurement system from first principles without prefabricated sensors.  
- Implement a potentiometer-driven **rack and pinion mechanism** to translate linear motion into voltage output.  
- Use Arduino to digitize analog voltage signals and display calibrated distance measurements.  
- Perform calibration with precision **gauge blocks** to establish an accurate measurement equation.  
- Quantify **systematic and random error** using statistical uncertainty analysis.  

## Outcomes
- Successfully designed and 3D printed a digital caliper-style measurement device.  
- Implemented an Arduino-based data acquisition system that converted potentiometer voltage into real distance values.  
- Derived a **linear calibration curve** with RÂ² = 0.9978, showing strong accuracy across the operating range.  
- Conducted an uncertainty analysis, determining maximum error of Â±0.13 inches.  
- Identified key improvements for future iterations, including a more robust potentiometerâ€“gear interface.
